### Interactive-Card-Component
- A simple interactive card component built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Brief
Your challenge is to build an interactive rating component that can be used for rating a product or a service. The user should be able to:
- Submit a rating.
- See the "Thank you" card state after successfully submitting a rating.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

You are free to choose the scale of your choice(e.g 1 - 5 checkboxes, 5 stars, a slider etc). Let your creativity flow!

## Instructions
